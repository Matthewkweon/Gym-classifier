Grip the barbell with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. Lower the bar to your mid-chest, then push it back up to the starting position.\n - **Targeted Muscles:** Primarily targets the pectoral muscles (chest). Secondary muscles worked include the triceps, shoulders, and to a lesser extent, the lats and forearms.\n\n2. **Tips for proper form or common mistakes to avoid:**\n - **Proper Form:** Keep your feet flat on the floor throughout the exercise. Your back should have a natural arch, with your upper back and buttocks in contact with the bench. Lower the bar to your mid-chest (avoid bouncing it off your chest). Fully extend your arms at the top of the movement but avoid locking your elbows.\n - **Common Mistakes to Avoid:** Avoid lifting your feet off the ground or moving them during the lift. Do not flare your elbows outward excessively; keep a slight inward angle. Ensure youâ€™re not using weights too heavy to maintain proper form. Avoid bouncing the bar off your chest, which can lead to injury.`;
